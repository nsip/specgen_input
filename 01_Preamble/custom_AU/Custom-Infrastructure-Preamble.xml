<Section name="What is SIF (AU)?">
  <p>
    SIF Implementation Specification (Australia) defines a set of data objects supporting the Australia's interoperability
    requirements for the education sector and combines this data model with established infrastructure protocols from the SIF Implementation Specification <a href="References.html#SIF">[SIF]</a>.
    SIF Implementation Specification (Australia) 1.4 leverages the SIF architecture and redefines the SIF infrastructure from
    SIF Implementation Specification 2.7 <a href="References.html#SIF_2_7">[SIF 2.7]</a> and for 3.x refers to SIF Implementation Specification 3.2 [SIF 3.2]  to support its data objects,
    with an Australia-specific namespace and the data objects defined in this specification.
    Technical readers should
    note that the version number internal to SIF XML messages identifies the version number of the SIF Infrastructure for 2.x implementations instead of the SIF Data Model version. This is the case for SIF Implementation Specification (Australia) 1.4, which for 2.x implementations, uses version <code>2.7</code>
    from SIF Implementation Specification 2.7.
