<Section name="What is SIF (NZ)?"
		 xmlns="http://sifassociation.org/SpecGen">
  <p>
    SIF Specification (New Zealand) defines a set of data objects
    supporting New Zealand's interoperability requirements for its
	education system and combines this data model with
    established infrastructure protocols from the SIF Implementation
    Specification <a href="References.html#SIF">[SIF]</a>.

	SIF Specification (New Zealand) 3.4 leverages the SIF architecture
	and refers to SIF Infrastructure Specifications greater than 3.0.1
	[SIF 3.x] to support its data objects, with a New Zealand-specific
	namespace and the data objects defined in this specification.
	Technical readers should note that the version number internal to
	SIF XML messages identifies the version number of the SIF Data
	Model.
