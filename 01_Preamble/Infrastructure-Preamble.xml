	<Section name="Abstract">
		<Section name="What is SIF?">
			<p>SIF is not a product, but a technical blueprint for enabling diverse applications to interact and share data related to entities in the pK-12 instructional and administrative environment. SIF is designed to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Facilitate data sharing and reporting between applications without incurring expensive customer development costs;</li>
				<li>Enhance product functionality efficiently; and</li>
				<li>Provide best-of-breed solutions to customers easily and seamlessly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The SIF Implementation Specification defines common data formats and rules of interaction and architecture, and is made up of two parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1. The <em>SIF Infrastructure</em> Implementation Specification which defines the rules of interaction and messages framework, and;</li>
				<li>2. The <em>SIF Data Model</em> Implementation Specification which is an XML-based data model that models entities in the learning environment as SIF Data Objects to be shared between applications;</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The <em>SIF Infrastructure</em> currently has two versions;</p>
			<p> The SIF 2.x Infrastucture comprises of;</p>
			<ul>
			<li>an XML-based messaging framework that allows diverse software applications to interoperate and share and report data related to entities in the pK-12 instructional and administrative environment;</li>
			<li>a HTTP(S)-based transport for conveying these SIF messages;</li>
				<li>an XML-based data model that models entities in the pK-12 environment as <em>SIF Data Objects</em> to be shared between applications.</li>
				<li>an abstract, platform-independent definition of a message queue for reliable delivery of asynchronous SIF messages and related synchronous
			administrative functions&#x2014;the <em>Zone Integration Server (ZIS)</em>; and</li>
				<li>an abstract, platform-independent definition of the interface between a software application and the ZIS&#x2014;the <em>SIF Agent</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			
	<p>SIF 3 Infrastructure defines;</p>
	<ul>
	<li>a secure REST-based transport protocol for defining both direct and brokered connections between software applications (which can act as REST servers or clients)</li>
	<li>a set of services to enable interactions between REST servers and clients, including creating environments, other administrative task, synchronous exchanges of data, and asynchronous message queues</li>
	<li>an abstract, platform-independent definition of the API between one software application and another or a broker.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The following definitions apply across 2.x Infrastucture versions:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>A <em>SIF Zone</em> is a distributed system that consists of a ZIS and one or more software applications 
		with a SIF Agent (a <em>SIF-enabled application</em>) sharing/reporting one or more SIF data objects over a network.  
		A <em>SIF Implementation</em> consists of one or more SIF Zones deployed and configured to meet customer data sharing and reporting needs.
		</li>
			<li>
		The SIF Implementation Specification defines architecture requirements and communication protocols for software components and the interfaces
		between them; it makes no assumption of specific hardware or software products needed to develop SIF-enabled applications and Zone Integration Server implementations, 
		other than their ability to support technologies leveraged as the foundation for SIF, most prominently XML and HTTP(S).
		</li>
	</ul>	
	<p>The following definitions apply across 3.x Infrastructure versions;</p>
	<ul>
	<li>A <em>SIF Environment</em> is a distributed system that may consist of middleware (a broker) and one or more software applications with a SIF Adapter (a <em>SIF-enabled application</em>) sharing/reporting one or more SIF data objects over a network. A <em>SIF Implementation</em> consists of one or more SIF Environments deployed and configured to meet customer data sharing and reporting needs.</li>	
	
	<li>The SIF Implementation Specification defines architecture requirements and communication protocols for software components and the interfaces between them; it makes no assumption of specific hardware or software products needed to develop SIF-enabled applications and/or middleware implementations, other than their ability to support technologies leveraged as the foundation for SIF, most prominently XML and HTTP(S) and including JSON and REST.</li>
	</ul>

		<Section name="Schools Interoperability Framework Association">
			<p>The Schools Interoperability Framework Association (SIF Association) is an industry initiative to enable interoperability and data sharing between
		software applications in the pK-12 instructional and administrative environment, and the forum for companies and educators to participate 
		in the development of SIF specifications in the SIF Association's working groups and task forces.  The SIF Association is designed to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Join industry leaders in creating the next-generation framework for education technology; and</li>
				<li>Leverage co-marketing opportunities with partners and distributors.</li>
			</ul>

	<Section name="Certification and Compliance Claims">
		<p>
        Though a product may be demonstrated to comply with this specification, no product may be designated as 
        <em>SIF Certified&#x2122;</em> by an organization
        or individual until the product has been tested against and
        passed established compliance criteria, published separately <a href="References.html#SIFCertification">[SIFCertification]</a>.  
				Organizations and individuals that are currently paying annual membership dues to the SIF Association 
        and dedicating resources to the initiative may also use the designation
